# BattleShip_Multiplayer_Game
## A BattleShip game was created using JetBrains
The Java version of the classic naval combat game "Battleship" is called Battleship with Java. The game offers a fun two-player tactical experience by adhering to Milton Bradley's original rules. In order to sink all of their opponent's ships before they do, players carefully arrange their fleet of ships on a 10x10 grid and alternately fire at them.
## Features
1. Establish the Field: To start, arrange the game field in accordance with the guidelines by presenting a blank grid with coordinates.     
2. Position Every Ship: Make sure the five ships—the destroyer, aircraft carrier, battleship, submarine, and cruiser—are arranged on the game field so they don't touch or overlap one another.     
3. Check Your Weapons: To test your new weaponry, practice firing at your own ships and provide feedback on hits and misses.     
4. Start using "Fog of War": By hiding ships behind the "fog of war," players can aim blindly at the fleet of their adversary.     
5. Describe the endgame guidelines: Define the terms of the game's conclusion; the winner is the player whose ships are all sunk.
